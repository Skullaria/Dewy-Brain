[Research] Dewey Brain â€” Modular, Edge-Capable LLM Architecture (RFC)

We propose a compressed core + semantic index + hot-swappable LoRA/TN blocks, maintained by a strict continual learning protocol (EWC, replay, canary + bandit). Targets low-latency edge inference with privacy.

Docs + diagram + references: https://github.com/<your-username>/Dewey-Brain
Looking for feedback on routing classifier features, hybrid TN choices (Tucker vs TT), and adapter fusion (TIES/DARE).
