I just published **Dewey Brain** — an architecture for **cognitive frugal intelligence**:

• Compressed core via tensor networks (CompactifAI-style)
• Semantic “Dewey” index for precise retrieval
• Hot-swappable LoRA/TN blocks for rare skills/knowledge
• Strict relearning protocol (EWC, replay, canary set, bandit scheduling)
