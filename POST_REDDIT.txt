Title: Dewey Brain — Cognitive Frugal Intelligence for Edge-Capable LLMs

I released an open RFC called **Dewey Brain**: compressed core (tensor networks), semantic Dewey-like index, hot-swappable LoRA/TN blocks, and a strict continual learning protocol (EWC, replay, canary + bandit). Aiming for edge latency + privacy without losing depth.

Feedback welcome—especially from people working on SLMs, TN compression, adapters, and continual learning.
